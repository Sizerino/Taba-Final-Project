                <h1 class="intro magenta">Where did the name come from?</h1>
                <p class="textarea springgreen">Marbles, said to be named due to the stone that they were manufactured from in the past, have been historically made of clay, and they were also produced using glass or stone. In addition, Marbles are most commonly made of glass, although steel, ceramic, plastic or clay is sometimes used.</p>
